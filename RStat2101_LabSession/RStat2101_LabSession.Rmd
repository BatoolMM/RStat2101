## Welcome

This is RStat2101, the R laboratory materials for the course STAT2101: Introduction to Statistics. The course is offered by the <a href="https://www.squ.edu.om/science/Departments/Statistics" target="_blank">department of Statistics</a> at <a href="https://www.squ.edu.om" target="_blank">Sultan Qaboos university</a>. R is an open-source statistical programming language for data analysis and data science. RStat2101 introduces the fundamentals of statistical analysis required to drive value from data. Here, you will learn how to explore data numerically and graphically using descriptive and basic inferential statistics. You will also learn how to find probabilities of the common distributions: Normal and Binomial.

If this is the first time you hear about R, the following short video created by R Consortium provides an overview about the program, its applications and what is used for.

## Install RStudio

In RStat2101, you are going to work with a user-friendly R interface called RStudio. It is an integrated development environment (IDE) for working with R. It is easy for writing scripts and has practical features for data analysis and visualizations. Check out Rstudio website to take a tour of <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/" target="_blank">RStudio's IDE</a>.

RStudio Desktop version is available in the Statistics Department computer laboratories, where RStat2101 sessions are run. However, if you are interested to install it on your personal computer, you need to install R first and then Rstudio.

-   To download and install R, click <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">here</a>
-   To download and install RStudio, click <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" target="_blank">here</a>

![](images/RstudioWelc.png){style="float: right; width: 200px; height: 200px;  "} For help installing R and RStudio, follow the installation instructions for <a href="https://rpubs.com/ImanAlhasani/RInstallationforWindows" target="_blank">Windows</a> users and <a href="https://rpubs.com/ImanAlhasani/RInstallationforMac" target="_blank">Mac</a> users (courtesy of Afra Al Manei, Department of Statistics, SQU). You can also sign up in <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/" target="_blank">RStudio Cloud</a> and use the online version of the program. Also, RStudio is available in Anaconda Navigator. However, R packages are not included in the default base environment and hence an R environment has to be created to run Rstudio. For help, see this <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/create-r-environment/" target="_blank">Anaconda Documentation</a>.

## Get Started

To use RStudio, you type code in it and ask the device to interpret them and act on their instructions. For some of you, this could be the first time you are coding, but do not worry! The course does not require to have any background in computer programming! Here, we will walk you through each of the steps required to begin using Rstudio. ![](images/r_learners_encouragement.jpeg){style="width: 900px; height: 400px;  "} Let us start your first R code! The following box is an empty code chunk provided to write and run code. For example, write `print("Welcome to R!")` and then click `Run Code`. The output will be shown below the chunk.

```{r welcome, exercise=TRUE}
```

Congrats, you've run your first line of code!![](images/happyR.png){style="float: right;    " width="160" height="87"}

#### Basic Operators:

The simplest and the most complicated calculations can be done using R easily. The basic mathematics operators are

| Addition | Subtraction | Multiplication | Division | Power |
|:--------:|:-----------:|:--------------:|:--------:|:-----:|
|   `+`    |     `-`     |      `*`       |   `/`    |  `^`  |

##### Exercise:

*Complete the following chunk by writing the correct operator to find:* $5+3$, $5-3$, $5\times 3$, $5/3$ and $5^3$.

```{r print-maths, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
# addition
5+3
```

```{r print-maths-hint}
# addition
5+3
# subtraction
5-3
# multiplication
5*3
# division
5/3
# power
5^3
```

##### Exercise:

*Calculate* $\frac{5\times 10^2}{3+4-2}$.

```{r mathscalculation, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
#Maths calculation
```

```{r mathscalculation-hint }
(5*(10^2))/(3+4-2)
```

#### Assigning Values

In order to record a value in memory, we assign the value to a variable using `<-`; `variable <- value`.

##### Exercise:

*Find* $X+Y$ and $X/Y$ *such that* $X=1$ *and* $Y=2$. *Then print the values of* $X$ *and* $Y$.

```{r assignvalue, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
#assign 1 to X and 2 to Y

```

```{r assignvalue-hint}
#assign 1 to a variable X and 2 to a variable Y
X <- 1
Y <- 2
# X+Y
X+Y
# X/Y
X/Y
#print X and Y
X
Y
# or 
print(paste("X=", X, "and Y=", Y))
#or simply
paste("X=", X, "and Y=", Y) #paste: returns the concatenate string
```

The value is not necessarily a number! It can be a word, letter, vector of numbers, data frame, function,.., etc.

##### Exercise:

*Modify the following code so that it prints your name and cohort*

```{r namecohort,exercise=TRUE}
myname <- "Afra"
cohort <- 2018
paste("Name: ",myname, ", Cohort: ", cohort)
```

## Data Basics

#### Vectors

A collection of values can be combined in an object called vector. To create a vector, use the *concatenate* or *combine* function `c()`. For example, to assign values 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2016 to a variable cohort, type `cohort <- c(2018, 2017, 2016, 2016)`.

```{r vector, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```

```{r vector-hint }
#create a vector 
cohort <- c(2018,2017,2016,2016)
cohort
```

##### Exercise:

*Create three vectors:* `cohort <- c(2018, 2017, 2016, 2016)`*,* `gender <- c("female", "male", "female", "male")` *and* `graduated <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)`.

```{r vectors, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```

```{r vectors-hint }
# create vectors
cohort <- c(2018,2017,2016,2016)
gender <- c("female", "male","female", "male")
graduated <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
cohort
gender
graduated
```

#### Basic Data type

To check the type of data, use `mode()`, `class()` or `typeof()`.

##### Exercise:

*Check the mode of the vectors:* `cohort`*,* `gender` *and* `graduated`.

```{r vectors-mode, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
cohort <- c(2018,2017,2016,2016)
gender <- c("female", "male","female", "male")
graduated <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)

```

```{r vectors-mode-hint}
# check the data type using mode()
mode(cohort)
mode(gender)
mode(graduated)

# check the data type using class()
# you can write more than one commands in one line with ; separator
class(cohort); class(gender); class(graduated)

# check the data type using typeof()
typeof(cohort); typeof(gender); typeof(graduated)

```

To check the length of a vector use `length()` function. To check both mode and length of a vector, use `str()` (structure) function. For example,to check the length of the vector gender, type `length(gender)` and to get mode and length information, type `str(gender)`

```{r vectors-length, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
gender <- c("female", "male","female", "male")
```

```{r vectors-length-hint}
gender <- c("female", "male","female", "male")
# check the length of gender
length(gender)
# check the mode and length of gender
str(gender)
```

To retrieve values from a vector, type the name of the vector followed by square brackets. In the square brackets, place the index of the value. For example, check the output of the following: `gender[2]` , `gender[2:3]`, `gender[c(1,3)]` and `gender[c(1:2,4)]`

```{r vectors-index,  exercise=TRUE,  exercise.eval=FALSE}
gender <- c("female", "male","female", "male")
gender[2]; gender[2:3]; gender[c(1,3)]; gender[c(1:2,4)]
```

#### Create a Data Frame

A data frame is a collection of vectors aligned in a tabular form in rows and columns. Each column represents a variable (vector) and each row represents an observation (values). To create a data frame use `data.frame()`. For example, Let's create a small data frame called `std_info` that takes the variables `cohort`, `gender` and `graduated`.

```{r dataframe, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
std_info <- data.frame (cohort = c(2018,2017,2016,2016),
                        gender = c("female", "male","female", "male"),
                        graduated = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))
std_info
```

```{r dataframe-hint}
# explore the following code!
cohort <- c(2018,2017,2016,2016)
gender <- c("female", "male","female", "male")
graduated <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
std_info <- data.frame (cohort, gender, graduated )
std_info
```

To get the structure of the data frame use `str()`. To get specific information about the data table such as number of columns, number of rows, number of rows and number of columns and the names of variables use `ncol()`, `nrow()`, `dim()` and `names()`, respectively.

##### Exercise:

*Explore the structure of the data frame* `std_info` *using* `str(std_info)`. *Then check the dimension of the data frame using* `dim(std_info)` *and list its variable names using* `names(std_info)`.

```{r dataframe-info, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
std_info <- data.frame (cohort = c(2018,2017,2016,2016),
                        gender = c("female", "male","female", "male"),
                        graduated = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))

```

```{r dataframe-info-hint}
# structure of std_info
str(std_info)
#dimension of std_info
dim(std_info)
#name of variables in std_info
names(std_info)
```

To refer to a value in the data frame, type the name of the data followed by square brackets. In the square brackets, place its row index and its column index separated by a comma. For example, to retrieve a data value in row 1 and column 2 from std_info, use `std_info[1,2]`. Explore the output of `std_info[,2]`, `std_info[1,]`, `std_info[1:2,1]` and `std_info[c(1,3),]`

```{r dataframe-subsetbracket,exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
std_info <- data.frame (cohort = c(2018,2017,2016,2016),
                        gender = c("female", "male","female", "male"),
                        graduated = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))

std_info[1,2]
```

```{r dataframe-subsetbracket-hint}
std_info[,2]  # returns the values in the second variable
std_info[1,]  # returns the values in the first row
std_info[1:2,1] # returns the values in the first two rows of the first variable
std_info[c(1,3),]# returns the values in the first and third rows
```

In addition, you can refer to a variable in the data table by typing the name of the data followed by `$` and the name of the variable. For example, extract the variable named cohort by typing `std_info$cohort`. Try to extract other variables.

```{r dataframe-subsetvar,exercise=TRUE,  exercise.eval=FALSE}
std_info <- data.frame (cohort = c(2018,2017,2016,2016),
                        gender = c("female", "male","female", "male"),
                        graduated = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))
# extract cohort variable
std_info$cohort

# try to extract the other variables 
```

You can also get a subset of a data frame based on logical evaluation or comparison using logical operators. Here are some of the most common logical operators:

| less than | less than or equal | greater than | greater than or equal | exactly equal | not equal | and | or  |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|    \<     |        \<=         |      \>      |          \>=          |      ==       |    !=     |  &  | \|  |

##### Exercise:

*Study the following commands and try to extract more subsets using different logical operators.*

```{r dataframe-logicalsubset,exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
std_info <- data.frame (cohort = c(2018,2017,2016,2016),
                        gender = c("female", "male","female", "male"),
                        graduated = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))

## examine each value in the variable graduate whether is "male" or not
std_info$gender == "male" 
## examine each value in the variable cohort whether is 2016 or not
std_info$cohort == 2016

#extract a subset of male students only
std_info[std_info$gender == "male",] 

#extract a subset of cohort 2016
std_info[std_info$cohort == 2016,] 

#extract a subset of cohort > 2016 and males
std_info[std_info$cohort > 2016 & std_info$gender=="male",] 

```

You can add a variable to the existing data frame by attaching it to the data using `$`. For example, to add a `gpa` variable to `std_info`: set values of the `gpa` variable in a vector and then attach it to the data table `std_info`.

```{r dataframe-addvar,exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
std_info <- data.frame (cohort = c(2018,2017,2016,2016),
                        gender = c("female", "male","female", "male"),
                        graduated = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))
std_info$gpa <- c(3.1, 2.7, 2.9, 2.5)
std_info

```

Data can be saved for a further work or to be shared with others. To save a data frame, you can use `write.csv()` to save in as csv file or `save()` to save it as RData file. For example, `write.csv(std_info,"std_info.csv", row.names = TRUE)` or `save(std_info, file = "std_info.RData")`. Make sure to save it in an accessible directory.

To import the saved data file, you can use `read.csv()` for csv data file or `load()` for RData file. For example `load(file = "std_info.Rdata")` or `read.csv(file = "std_info.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")`, where `sep = ","` tells that the file is comma delimited.

##### Practice Exercise:

> 1.  Create a folder on your desktop with a name RStat2101.
> 2.  Open RStudio IDE
> 3.  Set the folder RStat2101 as a working directory
> 4.  Create a new R Script and save it with a name practice1
> 5.  Type the following in the practice1 R script:

```{r practice1, echo=TRUE}
std_info <- data.frame (cohort = c(2018,2017,2016,2016), 
                        gender = c("female", "male","female", "male"), 
                        graduated = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))
```

> 6.  Save `std_info` as a csv file using `write.csv()` function.
> 7.  Read the saved csv file using `read.csv()` function.

## Data Exploration I

Data exploration is the initial statistical analysis that helps data analysts to understand data variables and uncover potential patterns. The exploration analysis involves summarizing data numerically and graphically using basic descriptive statistics and visualization tools. There are various statistical analysis tools to explore insights from data. In this section, we introduce the basic steps and tools of data exploration using R base functions. The focus will be on how to: import /load a dataset, identify variables and data types, tabulate data, describe variables numerically and display data graphically.

1.  **Import a Dataset:** Consider <a href="https://github.com/ggSamoora/Workshops/blob/main/R-Ladies%20Dammam/R-Ladies%20Dammam%20Data.csv" target="_blank">OpenSooq Apartments dataset</a> that was scrapped by <a href="https://github.com/ggSamoora/Workshops" target="_blank">Samer Hijjazi</a> in <a href="https://youtu.be/ByeNpxr3z0M" target="_blank">Arabic Web Scraping</a> session for <a href="https://twitter.com/OmanRusers?s=20&t=F8j1F6x6AlY0WrHSxGj-tw" target="_blank">Oman R Users</a>. The data set was originally in Arabic but translated, organized and cleaned by Samer to be useful to practice data analysis. The dataset is provided in the course Moodle page as well to practice during R laboratory session.

-   Import the dataset using `read.csv()` function:

```{r read-dataset1, echo=TRUE}
## import the dataset in the R environment
opensooq_apartments <- read.csv("opensooq_apartment.csv")
```

2.  **Identify Variables and Data Types:** Datasets vary in shapes and structures but the classical shape of the dataset consists of columns and rows, where each column represents a variable, each row represents observations and each cell represents a value. Thus, checking the structure of a dataset is important to identify the included variables and data types. In addition, viewing part of the dataset and displaying names of the variables will help you to get a better understanding of the data.

-   Display the names of the variables using `names()` function:

```{r names-dataset1, echo=TRUE}
## display the names of the variables
names(opensooq_apartments) 
```

-   Display the first six rows of the dataset using `head()` function:

```{r head-dataset1, echo=TRUE}
## display the first 6 rows of the data
head(opensooq_apartments)
```

-   Display the structure of the dataset using `str()` function:

```{r str-dataset1, echo=TRUE}
## display the data structure
str(opensooq_apartments)
```

The dataset consists of $2437$ observations and $9$ variables: two numerical variables and four non-numerical variables.

3.  **Tabulate Data:** Tabulation is a fundamental tool in data analysis, especially when exploring non-numerical data.

-   Tabulate one of the non-numerical variable (e.g. city), using `table()` function:

```{r tab-city, echo=TRUE}
## tabulate city variable 
table(opensooq_apartments$city)
```

-   Transform the table to get it in a classical format, using `transform()` function:

```{r tansf-tab-city, echo=TRUE}
## tabulate city variable such that city and frequency are in columns
transform(table(City=opensooq_apartments$city)) ## try without writing city =
```

-   Assign the frequency table to an object for further use.

```{r assign-tab-city, echo=TRUE}
## assign the table to an object for further use
city_table <- transform(table(City=opensooq_apartments$city)) 
```

-   Add the relative frequency to the frequency distribution using `prop.table()` function:

```{r relative-tab-city, echo=TRUE}
## add cummulative frequency to city_table
city_table$Percentage <- prop.table(city_table$Freq)*100 
## print the table
city_table
```

-   Add the cumulative frequency or relative cumulative frequency to the frequency distribution using `cumsum()` function:

```{r cumsum-tab-city, echo=TRUE}
## add cummulative frequency to city_table
city_table$Cum_Freq <- cumsum(city_table$Freq)
## print the table
city_table
```

```{r rel-cumsum-tab-city, echo=TRUE}
## add relative cummulative frequency to city_table
city_table$Cum_Percentage <- cumsum(city_table$Percentage)
## print the table
city_table
```

##### Exercise:

Tabulate the variable `furnished` by showing the category, frequency, relative frequency, cumulative frequency and relative cumulative frequency.

```{r tabulation, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```

```{r tabulation-hint }
# frequency distribution with catgeory and frequency
furnished_table <- transform(table(Furnished=opensooq_apartments$furnished))
## add relative frequency to furnished_table
furnished_table$Percentage <- prop.table(furnished_table$Freq)*100
## add cummulative frequency to furnished_table
furnished_table$Cum_Freq <- cumsum(furnished_table$Freq)
## add relative cummulative frequency to furnished_table
furnished_table$Cum_Percentage<- cumsum(furnished_table$Percentage)
## print the table
furnished_table
```

**Display Data Graphically:** Graphs are crucial aspects of data analysis as they show how data points are distributed and provide a way to see and understand patterns and outliers in data. In addition, graphs helps people with no statistics background to extract some information about data.

**4.1. Histogram:** The histogram is used to group numerical data into classes. To construct histogram use `hist()` function. For example: In OpenSooq Apprtments dataset, there two numerical variables: `size_in_m2` and `rental_price` . Consider the rental_price variable:

```{r hist, echo=TRUE}
# construct histogram of rental_price
hist(opensooq_apartments$rental_price)
```

-   ***Customize Histogram:*** The histogram can be customized by changing the title, labels, colors and number of classes. These features can be added inside the hist() function. To know more about the function type `help("hist")` in the console.

-   **Extract Information from Histogram:** The histogram graph can be assigned to an object and call information from it such as: class boundaries, midpoints, frequencies.

    ```{r customize-hist, echo=TRUE}
    ## customize the histogram and assign it to an object
    hist_price <- hist(opensooq_apartments$rental_price, 
         breaks= 5, #classes
         col= "royalblue", #color
         main= "Histogram of the Apartment Rental Price in Oman",  #title
         xlab="prices (OMR)", # x-axis label 
         ylab="No.of.apartments") # y-axis label
    ## display histogram information 
    hist_price
    ```

`hist_price$breaks` represents the classes with left-closed, right-open intervals, i.e. [0,200), [200,400), ..etc. `hist_price$counts` represents the frequencies, i.e. number of data points in each class. `hist_price$mids` represents the midpoints.

**4.2. Frequency Polygon:** The midpoints and frequencies are required to construct a frequency ploygon. Recall that one class is added below the lowest value and one above the highest value so the the polygon touches the x-axis on both sides. Thus, the midpoints and frequencies found from the histogram need a slight adjustment to be used in graphing polygon. Then `plot()` function can be used to plot the polygon.

```{r polygon, ech=TRUE}
class_width <- hist_price$mids[2]-hist_price$mids[1] #class width
mid_below_min <- min(hist_price$mids)-class_width #class below min
mid_above_max <- max(hist_price$mids)+class_width  #class above max
# combine the created midpoints with the existing midpoints
midpoints <- c(mid_below_min, hist_price$mids , mid_above_max) 
# combine the frequencies (0) of the created classes with the existing frequencies
frequency <- c(0, hist_price$counts , 0) 
# plot the polygon 
plot(midpoints, frequency, 
     #type of graph, 
     #b: points connected with lines
     #p: points
     #l: line
     type="b", #try to use "l" 
     col= "Darkred", #color
     main= "Distribution of the Apartment Rental Price in Oman",  #title
     xlab="prices (OMR)", # x-axis label 
     ylab="No.of.apartments") # y-axis label
```

**4.3. Cumulative Frequency Graph (Ogive):** The breaks and cumulative frequencies are required to construct an ogive. To calculate the cumulative frequency use `cumsum()` function.

```{r ogive, echo=TRUE}
# calculate the cummulative 
CumFreq <- cumsum(hist_price$counts)
## add 0 to the cummulative frequency 
## indicating there is no values less than the minimum
## use c() to combine 0 with the calculated CumFreq
CumFreq <- c(0, CumFreq)
 # plot the ogive
plot(hist_price$breaks, CumFreq, 
     type="l", #try to use "b" 
     col= "purple", #color
     main= "Cummulative Distribution of the Apartment Rental Price in Oman",  #title
     xlab="prices (OMR)", # x-axis label 
     ylab="No.of.apartments") # y-axis label
```

-   **Relative Frequency Graphs:** The relative frequency histogram, relative frequency polygon and cumulative relative frequency can be constructed using relative frequency calculation with `prop.table()` function. For example construct cumulative relative frequency graph and compare the y-axis of the graph with previous plot.

    ```{r ogive-perc, echo=TRUE}
    ## calculate cumulative relative frequency
    Cum_Rel_Freq <- prop.table(CumFreq)*100
     # plot the ogive
    plot(hist_price$breaks, Cum_Rel_Freq, 
         type="l", #try to use "b" 
         col= "deepskyblue4", #color
         main= "Cummulative Distribution of the Apartment Rental Price in Oman",  #title
         xlab="prices (OMR)", # x-axis label 
         ylab="% apartments") # y-axis label
    ```

-   **Grouped Frequency Distribution:** The information obtained from the histogram can be used to form the frequency distribution.

    ```{r g-freq-dist, echo=TRUE}
    ## identify the breaks!
    breaks <- c("[0-200)", "[200-400)", "[400-600)", "[600-800)", "[800-1000)")

**4.4. Other** **Graphs**

**4.4.1 Bar Graph:** The bar graph is widely used in practice to display non-numerical data. The base R function that is used to plot bar graphs is `barplot()` with two main arguments: `height` which takes numerical values that describe the length of the bar and the `names.arg` which takes the categories. Thus, the numerical values must be factorized by categorical levels. For more arguments run `help("barplot")` in the console.

-   **Simple Bar Graph:** Consider `city_table` that generated above. It summarizes the city names in 8 levels in `city_table$City`. The frequency and relative frequency of each level were calculated in `city_table$Freq` and `city_table$Percentage`.

```{r barplot-Freq, echo=TRUE}
#plot bar graph
barplot(city_table$Freq, names.arg=city_table$City,
        xlab="City", # x-axis label
        ylab="No.of.apartments",# y-axis label
        main="Distribution of Appartments by Cities",#title
        col="darksalmon",#color 
        cex.names=0.5)#size of names below bars. Exclude it or change the value! 
```

-   **Ordered Bar Graph:** The bars can be arranged from highest to lowest by plotting the ordered tabulated data. Use `order()` function to order the data.

```{r ordered-bargraph, echo=TRUE}
## order city table by Frequency column
order_city_table<- city_table[order(city_table$Freq,decreasing = TRUE),]
#plot ordered bar graph
barplot(order_city_table$Freq, names.arg=order_city_table$City,
        xlab="City", # x-axis label
        ylab="No.of.apartments",# y-axis label
        main="Distribution of Appartments by Cities",#title
        col="darksalmon",#color 
        cex.names=0.5)#size of names below bars. 
```

##### Exercise:

> Plot a bar graph that shows the percentage distribution of apartments by city.

-   **Grouped Bar Graph:** The bars can be split into groups to show two or more quantities.

```{r grouped-table, echo=TRUE}
## construct a table with two non-numerical variables:city & furnished
city_furnished_table <- table(opensooq_apartments$furnished, opensooq_apartments$city)
## print the table
city_furnished_table
```

```{r grouped-barplot-Freq, echo=TRUE}
## plot grouped barplot
barplot(city_furnished_table , 
        xlab = "Application", # x-axis label
        ylab="Frequency", # y-axis label
        main = "Distribution of Appartments by Cities and Furnished Status ",
        col = c("lightblue4", "lightpink4", "khaki"), #colors
        beside = TRUE, ## try beside = FALSE
        cex.names=0.5, #size of names below bars 
        legend.text = rownames(city_furnished_table), #furnished status levels
        args.legend = list(title = "Appartments Status",   
                           x = "topleft",
                           cex=0.7, 
                           bty = "n")#legend adjustments, see help("legend")
        )
```

**4.4.2 Pie Chart:** The pie chart is used to display non-numerical data with few categorical levels. The R base function for plotting pie chart is `pie()`. The function takes a main argument x: numerical values that display the areas of pie slices. The values can be frequencie, percentages or quantities. Consider `opensooq_apartments$furnished` variable with three levels. To show the variable in a pie chart, tabulate the variable first using `table()` function.

```{r pie-chart, echo=TRUE}
# frequency distribution with catgeory and frequency
furnished_table <- transform(table(Furnished=opensooq_apartments$furnished))
## add relative frequency to furnished_table
furnished_table$percent <- round(prop.table(furnished_table$Freq)*100,0)
furnished_table
## plot the pie chart
pie(furnished_table$percent,
    col=c("lightblue4", "lightpink4", "khaki"),
    main = "Appartments Status Distribution")

```

To customize labels, you can add `labels` argument with `paste()` function.

```{r pie-chart-Perc, echo=TRUE}
## change labels and add % to labels
pie(furnished_table$Freq,
    labels = paste(furnished_table$Furnished, furnished_table$percent, "%"),
    col = c("lightblue4", "lightpink4", "khaki"), 
    main="Appartments Status Distribution")
```

**4.4.3 Stem and Leaf Plot:** The stem and leaf plot summarizes numerical variable and keeps its original values. The R base function to construct steam and leaf is `stem()` function. To illustrate the stem and leaf display, consider subset of `opensooq_apartments$rental_price` variable, for example the first 50 observations.

```{r stem-leaf, echo=TRUE}
## plot stem and leaf of rental_price
## scale= 1 (defualt: single stem)
## scale=2 (double stem)
stem(opensooq_apartments$rental_price[1:50], scale = 1) 
```

The data graphics are the art of statistics for exploring the beauty of data and drive value from it. Here we have presented some common graphs but there are many to explore: some can be visulized using the R base functions, where others require some packages.
